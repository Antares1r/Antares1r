# Hey, I'm Eric
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a 14-year-old self-taught developer who loves coding cool projects and experimenting with new ideas. I primarily work with TypeScript and JavaScript, focusing on backend development with Node.js and some frontend work. 
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, C#
- I enjoy creating and managing Discord servers.

Happy coding! ✌️
